# Advent of Code

Working my way through the [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/) problems,
probably all in Clojure, although I'm not opposed to switching languages if it
happens to make sense for a particular problem.

I'm late to the party, so I'm starting on the 2015 problems in May 2018. I'll
catch up eventually.
