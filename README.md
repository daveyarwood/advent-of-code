# Advent of Code

Working my way through the [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/) problems,
probably all in Clojure, although I'm not opposed to switching languages if it
happens to make sense for a particular problem.

## Running puzzle solutions

First, install the [Clojure CLI][clojure-cli], if you don't already have it.

You can then use the `run` script to run the main function for a particular
puzzle. For example:

```bash
# Run advent.2015.12.01.puzzle-1/-main
bin/run :year 2015 :day 1 :puzzle 1
```
