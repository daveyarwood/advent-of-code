  "I'm just gonna skip this one. I don't know what it is these grid problems,
   but they're confusing and exhausting to do. I had trouble with the
   grid-related problems from prior years, too.

   I managed to solve puzzle 1, but it took a long time because I had a subtle
   edge case bug that wasn't tested by the example input, so that held me up
   for a while.

   Then I got to puzzle 2, and it was clear that I would need to pretty much
   start over and take a different approach, and I wasn't having fun anymore
   at that point, so I skipped it. Enough grid problems!")
